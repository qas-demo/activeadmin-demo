bundle exec rails s
```

If you are using VirtualBox to manage docker machines, ensure you have enabled port forwarding.
  * Open VirtualBox. Go to Network Settings of the docker machine.
  * Click port forwarding
  * Add a new rule with the following details
    * Name: `Gauge`
    * Protocol: `TCP`
    * Host IP: `127.0.0.1`
    * Host Port: `8000`
    * Guest IP: `127.0.0.1`
    * Guest Port: `8000`

## Building WAR
The application can be packaged using JRuby + Warbler and generate an executable `war`. This artifact is hosted in [Bintray]()

### Prerequisites

- Install JDK
- Install JRuby (can use rvm or just install JRuby directly). Tested with Ruby 2.3.1, JRuby 9.1.7
- run `rake war`, this should generate `activeadmin-demo.war`

### Using the Artifact

- The `activeadmin-demo.war` generated is an executable war, and comes with an embedded Jetty instance. This is to facilitate self hosting.
- Run `java -jar activeadmin-demo.war`.
